# C# Beginner Exercises

This repository contains a collection of C# projects, exercises, and code files that I worked on during my university studies to learn and practice C# programming. These projects served as a valuable learning resource, allowing me to explore various concepts and techniques in C# and Windows Forms application development.

## About

During my coursework, I was introduced to C# and the Windows Forms framework, which provided a solid foundation for building desktop applications. These projects cover a wide range of topics, from basic programming concepts like loops and data structures (arrays, lists, etc.) to more advanced topics like object-oriented programming, event handling, and user interface design.

The final assignment for this course was to create a calorie tracking application built using Windows Forms. This project allowed me to apply my knowledge of C# and Windows Forms to create a practical and interactive application. The project files for the calorie tracking application will be uploaded to this repository after receiving the final results.

## Technology Stack

- **Library/Template**: Windows Forms
- **IDE**: Visual Studio 2022 (This code should be compatible with other recent Visual Studio versions as well.)

## Projects

Here's a brief overview of the projects included in this repository:

1. **Beginner Exercises**: This folder contains basic exercises and code snippets focused on learning fundamental concepts such as loops, conditionals, data structures, and console output.
2. **Pattern Printing**: Explore a collection of exercises that involve printing various patterns, like pyramids and triangles, using loops and conditional statements.
3. **Calorie Tracking Application**: A Windows Forms application that allows users to track their daily calorie intake and expenditure through various activities. This project showcases the use of multiple forms, event handling, and user input validation. (Project files will be uploaded after receiving final results)

## Contributing
